### Instructions
- In server.js, make a server that will serve all the files in the html folder.  See <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTOaV0wMI00kRI8qP9_Ej6FI1kiOnmDU36jInpipsAk9ZOxeVekwpinvSwNixmLyVBOxE65izdalQT9/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p" target="_blank">the node slides</a> for details.
- in the html folder is a client file named client.html
- Start up your server (node server.js) and then go to your client.html file in your browser.
	- instructions are in your server.js file under PART1.  Also see the slides above.
- modify your webserver
	- add an endpoint to serve data
	- in server.js, there is already a variable loaded with data.  It's called, ironically, data
	- further step-by-step instructions are in the heading PART2 in the server.js file.
	- Your endpoint should serve the same data as <a href="http://danielpaschal.com/phpnodeintro/server.php" target="_blank">this endpoint.</a>  
	- YOU ARE NOT SIMPLY USING THE ABOVE ENDPOINT.  YOU ARE CONSTRUCTING YOUR OWN ENDPOINT TO RETURN THE SAME INFORMATION!
