### Introduction

#### Part 1
- start mamp
- go to mamp preferences and redirect the document root to your LFZ folder on your desktop
- run your part1/phpintro__source.php and see the output
- go to your part1/phpintro_destination.html and duplicate the output of the php file using only JS/jQuery

#### Part 2
- start mamp
- run the part2/client.html file to use the premade front end
- go to part2/server.php and fill in the required lines.  Some code is done for you, but the remainder have comments for you to write code to.  At the end, data should show up on the client.html page when it runs.
