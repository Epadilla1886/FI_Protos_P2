### Introduction

#### one-time pre-start instructions for setting up mamp
- start mamp (NOT mamp pro)
- change the web document root of MAMP
	- go to MAMP (in mamp's menu) and to go preferences
	- go to the web server tab
	- click on "select" to change the web document root
	- navigate to your lfz folder (usually in your desktop)
	- select / choose the lfz folder as your web document root
- open up your desired page
	- go back to main mamp interface
	- click on "open webstart page"
	- make a note of your server's port.
		- eg "localhost:8080" or "localhost:8888"
		- if it has a number, you'll need to use that port in ALL communication with your webserver.  If it doesn't have a number, it is "port 80" and you don't need to specify it (it is the default)
	- go to the URL in the browser of the MAMP welcome page
		- it will look something like this http://localhost:8866/MAMP/?language=English
	- take EVERYTHING from MAMP to the end and DELETE it
	- your web page should be a navigatable set of links
		- if it is not, you have an index.html file in that folder.  Rename / delete it and try again
	- navigate to your desired page
	- click on page
	- follow further instructions


#### Part 1
- start mamp (see above)
- navigate to your prototypes_fi_part2/php_intro/part1 folder
- run phpintro_source.php and see the output
- make phpintro_destination.html do the same thing
	- go to your part1/phpintro_destination.html and code JS/jQuery to produce the same output as the phpintro_source.php
- test the output of your file versus the output of the source file

#### Part 2
- start mamp
- prototypes_fi_part2/php_intro/part1 folder/part2 folder
- run your client.html file.  It is already pointing to the <a href="http://danielpaschal.com/phpnodeintro/server.php" target="_blank">folder</a>.  
	- put the necessary url in your browser.  For example --- localhost:8888/prototypes_fi_part2/php_intro/part2/client.html ---
- alter your server.php file to produce the same output as the above listed server.
